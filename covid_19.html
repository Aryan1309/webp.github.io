<h1>1. What is coronavirus? </h1>
<p>

A coronavirus is a type of common virus that can infect your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. They can spread much like cold viruses. Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child.<br>

Most coronaviruses are not dangerous, but some are. Those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS ) can be deadly.<br>
</p>

<h1>2. COVID-19</h1>
<p>COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. The COVID-19 is the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.<br>
Public health authorities are learning more every day. We will continue to update as we learn more.</p>


<h1>3. Symptoms</h1>
<img src="https://www.mygov.in/sites/all/themes/mygov/images/covid/symptoms.png">
<p>The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have no symptoms at all. People who are older or who have existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, or who have compromised immune systems may be at higher risk of serious illness. This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza.</p>

<h3>a. Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may appear two to 14 days after exposure and can include:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Cough</li>
	<li>Difficulty in breathing</li>
	<li>Tiredness</li>
	<li>Aches</li>
	<li>Runny nose</li>
	<li>Sore throat</li>
	<li>Tastelessness</li>
	<li>Anosmia- (Loss of ability to smell)</li>
</ul>
<h1>4. When to see a doctor</h1>
<img src="https://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Doctors_Who_Treat_Dementia-732x549-thumbnail.jpg" width="450" height="300">
<ul>
		
<li>If you have COVID-19 symptoms or you've been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, contact your doctor or clinic right away for medical advice. Tell your health care team about your symptoms and possible exposure before you go to your appointment.</li>

<li>If you have emergency COVID-19 signs and symptoms, such as trouble breathing, chest pain or pressure, confusion, or blue lips or face, seek care immediately.</li>

<li>If you have respiratory symptoms but you are not and have not been in an area with ongoing community spread, contact your doctor or clinic for guidance. Let your doctor know if you have other chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease or lung disease. As the pandemic progresses, it's important to make sure health care is available for those in greatest need.</li>
</ul>
<h1>5. Causes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Infection with the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>

<li>It's unclear exactly how contagious the new coronavirus is. Data has shown that it spreads from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks.</li>

<li>It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes.</li>
</ul>

<h1>6. Risk Factors/Transmission</h1>
<img src="https://www.mygov.in/sites/all/themes/mygov/images/covid/block-one.png">
<h3>Risk factors for COVID-19 appear to include:-</h3>
<ul>


<li>Recent travel from or residence in an area with ongoing community spread of COVID-19 as determined by CDC or WHO.</li>
<li>Close contact with someone who has COVID-19 â€” such as when a family member or health care worker takes care of an infected person.</li>
</ul>
<h1>7. Prevention</h1>
<img src="https://www.mygov.in/sites/all/themes/mygov/images/covid/block-two.png">
<p>Although there is no vaccine available to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, you can take steps to reduce your risk of infection. WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions for avoiding COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid large events and mass gatherings.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.</li>
<li>Keep distance between yourself and others if COVID-19 is spreading in your community, especially if you have a higher risk of serious illness.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you're sick.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily.</li>
<li>Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care.</li> 
<li>Avoid taking public transportation if you're sick.</li>
</ul>
